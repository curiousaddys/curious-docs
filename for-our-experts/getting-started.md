In the popup that appears, select your preferred authentication method. In this guide, we'll login via Discord.

!!!
We recommend connecting Discord, especially if you a [Curious Addys](https://curiousaddys.com) holder, as you will receive additional benefits on our site.

![Select either Discord or Google](/static/images/getting-started-2.png)

You will be redirected to the account provider you chose, follow the prompts to login. For Discord, click "Authorize" in the bottom right of the popup message.

==- Concerned about what permissions we're requesting from Discord? Click here.
Some users have expressed concern about what permissions we're requesting from Discord, so we wanted to be very clear about the information we're connecting and how we use it.

:icon-check-circle-fill: **Access your username, avatar, and banner**

We use this information to set your username and profile picture on our site.

:icon-check-circle-fill: **Access your email address**

We use your email to send you notifications when someone answers a question you have posted (or a question that you have followed). You may opt out of these questions at any time from your profile page or using the link at the bottom of every email we send you.

:icon-check-circle-fill: **Know what servers you're in**

The only check we make on this information is if you are a member of the [Curious Addys Discord](https://discord.gg/catc), and this is connected to the following piece of information we request.

:icon-check-circle-fill: **Read your member info (nickname, avatar, roles, etc...) for servers you belong to**

We only check in the [Curious Addys Discord](https://discord.gg/catc) if you have the role which means you are a holder of a Curious Addy. We will eventually replace this system with a wallet connection on this site, but your roles in our Discord is a quick way for us to check this information until that wallet connection system is implemented.

After authorizing your account with your authentication provider, you will be sent back to our site, logged in!
