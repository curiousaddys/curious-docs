# Ask Anonymously

Asking questions online can feel intimidating, and sometimes you might not want to show your username when you ask questions. Don't worry, we have you covered!

We've implemented functionality to allow anyone to ask questions anonymously.

All you need to do is to check "Ask anonymously" when asking a question:

![](/static/images/ask-anonymously.png)

If you ask a question anonymously, it will just show up as "Member asked anonymously" like below:

![](/static/images/asked-anonymously.png)

While anonymous questions won’t show up in your activity feed and won’t be associated with your username, you’ll still earn points when people upvote your question.

Final note - please keep in mind that if you reply to answers on your question, your reply won’t be anonymous.
